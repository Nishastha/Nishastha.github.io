            <p>
              Established in 2004 B.S. Saraswati Niketan has served the nation
              well in terms of spreading the light of education and producing
              eligible human resources in different fields. The school was
              initiated by a local lad of 'Jyapu' community to educate the
              young boys of his community in a congested room on the ground
              floor of his home. When the number of students increased, it
              moved from place to place and finally landed at its present
              location which was a falcha (inn) in front of Shesh Narayan
              Temple. With more than 7 decades of glorious history, the school
              recently celebrated its 75th anniversary. In the changing
              scenario, the school is trying to adapt new pedagogies to
              inculcate 21st-century skills in the students.
            </p>
            <p>
              Situated in a Newar community, the rich tangible and intangible
              cultural heritage are just next door, which provide students
              with living examples of the things they study in their textbooks
              and ample opportunities for the students to learn through social
              interaction. The school is now adopting culturally responsive
              pedagogy as the school's signature pedagogy to use those
              cultural heritages adopting the progressive pedagogy in the
              teaching and learning process. With programs such as Computer
              Engineering from grade 9 to 12, we are promoting technical
              education. Implementing an integrated curriculum and
              portfolio-based assessment are some of the innovative programs
              going on in her school. With less than 4 aana land the school
              maintains its greenery through bottle gardening. The
              mobilization of the eco club and integrating bottle gardening
              with curriculum and assessment are some of the attempts to
              ensure the sustainability of this green school program.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the passing time we are launching new programs to meet the
              changing needs of society. Our main concern is our students and
              their holistic development and secured future!
