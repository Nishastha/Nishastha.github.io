                <p>
                  Our school is well equipped with many facilities. One of them
                  is a computer lab with advanced computers. We do many programs
                  in languages like C, C++, HTML, CSS, java, etc. Students from
                  1st to 12th have opportunities to do programming. It is the
                  space where an entire class can be taught important concepts
                  of computer.

                  Electronic lab is another significant attraction where we
                  construct electronic circuits using analog or digital ICs. The
                  experiments covered in this laboratory are synchronized with
                  its theoretical part so that students might be able to
                  understand its practical part. The laboratory emphasizes to
                  gain hands-on experiences of electronic components.

                  Science is the study of the nature and behaviour of natural
                  things and the knowledge that we obtain about them. Laboratory
                  experiences are essential for students in many science
                  courses. Science Labs provide students with various
                  opportunities to learn and experiment new and existing things.
